I picked up a JVC KW-M730BT at the blue and yellow big box store for 0 + sales tax last night for my birthday. I plan on installing it this weekend so I'll make a post about my initial impressions in a few weeks. It looks to be pretty decent in the SQ area too, 24 bit DAC and can play 192kHz FLAC files as well as DSD files. Also has a 13 band EQ, time correction, and 4 volt line level outputs. SNR is claimed to be at 98.5dB but as I found out with my Sony WX-900BT that can be misleading de Twitter via LamaDeFortnite sur Twitter (http://twitter.com/LamaDeFortnite).

Started with basic web dev and transitioned. Progress progressing. Hey guys, I just finished reading Head First Java by Kathy Sierra and I wanted to start learning Android Development. So I'm planning on buying the Head First Android Development by Dawn Griffiths. Any feedback after reading this book? If you have other suggestions, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks. 
I am currently learning to make Android apps. I've taken the Udacity Android Basics course and want to advance further. I am using a copy of Head First Android Development because its really expensive for the digital version with DRM. I am going to buy some books on Amazon so I might consider picking up some Android books. Anyway, do you use physical books for learning or do you advise against. Can someone recommend me which of this books for android development should I read: 1.The Busy Coder's Guide to Android 2.Hello Android 3.Sam's Teach yourself Android Application Development in 24 Hours 4Android Application Development- All in One Dummies 5.Beginning Android Tablet Development 6.Professional Android 4 Application Development Book 7.Android Programming - the big nerd ranch guide 8.Android: Programming in a Day! The Power Guide for Beginners In Android App Programming 9.Android. Hello, I am a informatics student and I already developed two small Android applications during the last years. But my Android knowledge ist pretty fragmentary and I would like to buy a book, where I can find all important things and concepts about Android to improve and extend my knowledge. There are three books, I found: O'Reilly: Android Cookbook: Problems and Solutions for Android Developers O'Reilly: Head First Android Development: A Brain-Friendly Guide Big Nerd Ranch: Android Programmi. 
Hi everyone. I'm working my way through Head First Android Development. I'm currently on Chapter 3, which gets started with a very simple app in which the user enters a string (CreateMessageActivity), and then when they press a button, the string is displayed with a new activity/layout (ReceiveMessageActivity). ampnbsp; I have everything working just fine, but I'm confused about the logic. ampnbsp; Here's a snippet of code from CreateMessageActivity: public void onSen. I just finished reading Head First Android Development and it covered many parts about Android development but it didn't cover graphics coding, and my main goal was to build an Android game. I have a fair knowledge in opengl 4.0 from years back when I coded in Windows, but I never developed for mobile until now. So my question is, where's the best place to start? Any tips and recommended books or internet sources for this subject would be welcomed. Thanks. Hi /r/LearnJava community! I've been self-studying Java for about a month and a half now and learning how to develop in Android Studio. I've been using this book (https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Android-Development-Brain-Friendly/dp/1449362184/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8ampqid=1489689467ampsr=8-1ampkeywords=head+first+android+development) to help me study and I must say it is a solid book if you want to get into android development. Although I am enjoying the book, I have been running I've taught myself python from absolutely no idea what programming is to. being able to create scrapers and use web frameworks such as flask. and do all sorts of other stuff in python. I've learned OOP as well since python is multi paradigmed OOP and Functional. So I decided hey let's learn Android! lo and behold. I feel like a blundering idiot. currently I am using the Head First Android Developement book. it's great you can follow along.but there are so many things that leave you wondering. 
What should I learn to become an Indie Mobile Game Developer? Im currently reading Head First Android then I'll read about android game development. Next year Ill be reaging about iOS and iOS game development. All this with books and making the excersices and examples in the book. Is this path correct. I'm an absolute beginner in Android development, and after skimming through the top posts here I've narrowed my textbook choice to two books: - Head First Android Development (Dawn Griffiths, David Griffiths) - Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 2nd Edition (Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Hardy, Kristin Marsicano) Do you have any experience with these two? Which one would be more suitable for someone with zero experience with Android development? Or perhaps there is something. </p>
