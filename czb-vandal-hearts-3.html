Hi All, amp#x200B; I am curious about buying a PS Classic, I just have a few questions that hopefully you guys could shed some light on. First off, I have no problem hard/soft modding this console if I need to. That being said, are there options for making the emulation itself better? And how is good is overall compatibility with current mods? I am mainly interested in RPGS, JRPGS, and Strategy RPG's (like FFT, Vandal Hearts, etc). Any input on this topic would be appreciated.

Critics generally praised the incorporation of three-dimensional terrain and positioning into combat strategy, the sound effects, and the visual spectacle of the spells. I'm trying to clear out some of my collection. Taking up to much space and I want to own less things. I will take pictures on request.

I threw together the price list with pretty little research, so changes might be made as I go along and don't be afraid to make offers. Some might have stickers or minor defects on the box or game.

Basically, I hate the chibi style (my dream would be a game in the style of Vandal Hearts II, but I can't find anything remotely close to it anywhere) and I am not an artist myself, so my plan was to make the game I want anyway and maybe hire an artist later if, by any chance, the game generates some kind of revenue (unlikely, but still, one can dream.). How realistic is that? Would changing the sprites be feasible, or would that just be a nearly impossible.

Among one of the first tactical role-playing games to land on western shores, Vandal Hearts follows the trials and triumphs of Ash Lambert, and the oppressive conflict that threatens all of Sostegaria. Hi all, I've noticed a random frame rate issue when I display the PCSX menu (select+triangle) and then resume the game. The frame rate of the game may takes a continuous noticeable hit until I display the menu and resume again (may need to do that multiple times to fix frame rate). It seems to happen only on 30fps games (I experienced it on crash bandicoot, vandal hearts 2, thousand arms, chrono cross, etc.), randomly but frequently (I'd say 40% of the time), each time pcsx menu is invoked. Feb 23, 2016 @ 3:24pm Originally posted by Melodia: Vandal Hearts is horrible. I mean . But otherwise, I'd argue that Vandal Hearts, with its surprisingly very well designed battlefields and varying mission/formation style made it one of the better entries of the genre So i've played FFT almost yearly since I was in fourth grade when the game came out. Ever since then I've tried to find more games in the most similar of playstyle. I found Tactics Ogre not long after I beat FFT for the first time. I also love that game and have played it quite a bit. Over the years i've searched desperately to find any game that fulfills the same game desire. I've played the FFTA games and though I enjoyed them quite a bit I have the same underwhelming complaint.
