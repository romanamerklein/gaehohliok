I’ve been daily driving Corvettes for the past (7) years or so. I had 5 years in an old C5 Corvette and spent the last two years in a C7 Grand Sport. While I love Corvettes my life has slowly become more complicated to the point where daily driving a C7 Grand Sport has been less and less of a joy. Now don’t get me wrong, Corvettes are the most daily-able sports cars you can get. Plenty of trunk room, an honest 30mpg if you drive them calmly, the cars are reliable, and they are generally affor.

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be. I have a question regarding a gaming pc that isn’t too fancy just something that will last me a bit and that I can play the games I have on. I was at Costco the other day and saw this pc it looked pretty good to me, much better than what I have currently. I’m wondering if it will serve my needs adequately or if I should get some help from you guys building something.

Well fret not as there is an easy method to get updates as soon as they are available. No need to wipe data, have carrier bloatware, tethering limitations, doesnt matter which carrier you already use, and keep receiving OTA updates. What we will do use the is use the Sprint's unlocked firmware variant (which is almost always the first to get the updates) to update the generic unlocked firmware (which Hashrate report Specs: Algorithm/Coin : Cryptonight R - Monero Cards : Vega 64, samsung, air cooled ODT Clocks : 1408/1107/875 HWinfo Clocks : `1356/1107/850` Driver : 18.6.1 OS : Windows 10 1709 \ If you are using linux, just go to MMPOS-gtTRM-gtSmart tune-gtCN/high\ amp#x200B; Results: SRBMiner 1.8.7 - \ --disabletweaking\ ; Miner HR : 2012 h/s ; HR - Devfee : `1995 h/s` TeamRedMiner 0.4.5 - \ --cn\_config=15+15\ ; Miner

Hi /r/DotA2, please watch this video (from a bot game) and understand my pain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGHiKH-Nj94 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGHiKH-Nj94) Did you notice at the 9 second mark? That is my life every 3-10 minutes in a normal game. The stutter can last fractions of a second or longer. It seems completely random. I thought my older computer was the problem so I made a new build with very little change : 3D Mark Scores: https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/34695420 (https.

When I connect my Note 9 to my Windows PC with ADB and Samsung Drivers installed, I get no Data Transfer connectivity, just charging from the laptop to the phone. Thanks. TLDR: after 6 months, best Android phone, by far, I have ever owned (it's my fourth Android - I'm talking about the unlocked version here). And the biggest reason can be summed up in three words: performance, performance, and performance. After half a year it's as good or better than the day I took it out of the box - but the next 6-18 months of course are far more important (if I keep it that long). \--- amp#x200B; It's a little weird, but inevitable given their practices Hey guys, my monitors (dual) will both go off showing "No Displayport signal detected" it happens every once in a while throughout the day.I'd be playing a game or away from PC. monitors just turn off (no Signal from Display Port) and you cant do anything other than a hard reset. When that happens in-game, its usually just after a small freeze in game. and boom monitor off, no signal. I cant figure out what is wrong, did all of the steps suggested that I could find online, such as power settin. Today I asked a question on here and mentioned I had root. This caused a few people to ask for a guide on how I got it. So, here it is: #Six initial things of immediate note before starting!: 1) This is for the exynos version (my specific phone is an international S9+ (G965f) running Pie and xposed, but it should also work with all Exynos S9/S9+'s) 2) As /u/Revanthmk23200 pointed out - getting root access on these phones trips a switch to say "this phone is no longer in warranty". This switch. </p>
